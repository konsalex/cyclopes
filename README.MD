## Description

**Cyclopes is lightweight CLI tool to help us perform simple visual testing tasks, so we can feel more confident shipping our code.**

Visual testing with Cyclopes includes screenshotting our desired pages, but also sending the results to the tools we use (like Slack) so we can make a quick review.

Some useful use cases:

1. Visual test your GatsbyJS/NextJS etc. marketing websites. If you are not writing tests (which is often the case with marketing websites), you can use **cyclopes** to check if your website is rendered as expected.

2. Integrate visual testing with your CI, and send generated screeenshots to a dev Slack channel. The screenshots can be taken from Cypress.js or any other E2E testing framework you already use.

**Cyclopes** is only using Chrome to test as it is based in [chromedp](https://github.com/chromedp/chromedp).

> ðŸ’¡ Cyclopes is not Visual Testing as a Service (Percy, Chromatic etc), but something to bridge the gap between not having a visual test, and having a complicated setup to work with.

## Installation

With `npm` or `yarn`

```bash
# npm
npm install cyclopes

# yarn
yarn add cyclopes
```

With `go get`

```bash
go get -u github.com/konsalex/cyclopes
```

Or you can download the binaries directly from [Github releases](https://github.com/konsalex/cyclopes/releases).

## How to use

The usage is fairly simple. You can run

```
cyclopes
```

which will try to find the default yaml file `cyclops.yml` in the current directory.

If you want to use a different file name, you can use

```bash
cyclopes --config=./your-config.yml
```

## How to configure

The configuration (yaml) file will start with two root steps, the `visual` and `adapters`, both which are optional. Below is an example of a yaml configuration file and below a table with the values and their possible options.

```yaml
# Directory where the images will be saved
# and/or retrieved from the channel adapters
imagesDir: "./images"

# If visual is defined, it will be the first step
# where the pages defined will be visited and screenshotted
# one by one with the defined order
visual:
  # (Optional): URL to visit. If this field does
  # not exist, builDir is required
  remoteURL: https://www.neo4j.com/
  # Directory to serve for testing.
  # Required only if remoteURL is missing
  buildDir: "./public"
  # If the testing session will be headless or not
  # for debugging purposes
  headless: true
  # Pages to visit and screenshot
  pages:
    # Path of the page
    - path: "/"
      # Type of device to screenshot
      device: "both"
      # Delay after the page is loaded
      delay: 2000
      # Wait for an element to appear
      waitSelector: "#NeoCybotCookiebotDialogBodyButtonAccept"
      # If the screenshot should be fullpage or viewport
      screenshot: "fullpage"
      # Code to be executed inside the webpage
      # This can help to remove Cookies banner for example
      code: |
        const cookiesButton = document.querySelector("#NeoCybotCookiebotDialogBodyButtonAccept")
        if (cookiesButton) {
            cookiesButton.click()
        }
    - path: "/product"
      device: "mobile"
      screenshot: "fullpage"
    - path: "/product/graph-data-science/"
      device: "desktop"
# Adapters
# Each adapter will have it's own parameters
adapters:
  slack:
    OAUTH_TOKEN: example-token
    CHANNEL_ID: example-token
```

## ðŸ”Œ Adapters

Right now only Slack adapter is supported.

Soon more will be added like Trello etc. Any recommendation is welcome.

### Slack adapter

<details>
<summary>Expand</summary>

```yaml
slack:
  oauth_token: example-token
  channel_id: example-channel-id
```

or as _environment variables_

```sh
export ADAPTERS_SLACK_CHANNEL_ID=example-channel-id
export ADAPTERS_SLACK_OAUTH_TOKEN=example-token
```
